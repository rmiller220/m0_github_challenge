# GitHub Steps

Describe in your own words how to establish a connection between a local repository and a remote repository on GitHub.
-first create a new directory that you want on github
-run git init to initialize git and add any files that you want using git add <filename>
-commit using git commit, with "initial commit" as the first one. 
-then you want to create a new repository on github, make sure you select the SSH optiion and NOT the HTTPS
-using the copy button, you will then use the option to push an existing repository from the command line. This creates a connection that flows upstream from your local device to github and in the cloud
-lastly refresh github to make sure it went through. you should see the file you created on github now
